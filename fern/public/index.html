<h1>Welcome to the Memory Garden</h1>
<a href="login.html">Passage</a>

<p>As a user, you can create a personalized Memory Garden to capture those memories that are important to you. You can "plant" pictures, drawings, and notes into the Garden, and you can explore your past memories by walking around the Garden.</p>
<p>Memories are sorted by time of planting, and each time you visit a memory, you water it, and it grows into a taller plant.</p>
<p>To plant a new memory, tap the Plant button, and attach your note, drawing, or picture to be planted, then select the color for the flower. To walk through the garden, swipe left and right or tap the arrow keys. To view a past memory, tap on the corresponding flower. This will allow you to water it so that it grows into a bigger flower.</p>
